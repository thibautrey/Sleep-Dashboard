# AGENTS

This file provides guidelines for contributors and automated agents working in this repository.

- Use **TypeScript** for all backend and frontend code.
- Keep documentation in sync with implemented features.
- Run available formatting and linting commands before committing if they exist in the project.
- Source code should reside in a `src/` directory when introduced.
- Use Docker Compose for local development with Postgres.
- Write clear, concise commit messages summarizing changes.

There are currently no automated tests, but future tasks will introduce them. When tests are available, run them before each commit.
